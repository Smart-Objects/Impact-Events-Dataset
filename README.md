# Dataset outline
This repository contains a novel time-series dataset for impact detection and localization on a plastic thin-plate, towards Structural Health Monitoring applications, using ceramic piezoelectric transducers (PZTs) connected to an Internet of Things (IoT) device. The dataset was collected from an experimental procedure of low-velocity, low-energy impact events that includes at least 3 repetitions for each unique experiment, while the input measurements come from 4 PZT sensors placed at the corners of the plate. For each repetition and sensor, 5000 values are stored with 100 KHz sampling rate. The system is excited with a steel ball, and the height from which it is released varies from 10 cm to 20 cm.

Feature list can be found in  feature_list.json file or together with their description in this image file.
